# Faulty Calculator

A simple calculator application with intentionally introduced faults. This project is meant for educational purposes, demonstrating how errors can manifest in software, or simply for a bit of fun.

## Features

* Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Deliberate faults that produce incorrect results.
* A colorful and user-friendly interface.

## Intended Faults

_Note: These are examples, you can customize them as you like._

* **Addition:** Sometimes adds an extra '1' to the result.
* **Subtraction:** May return the absolute difference instead of the actual result.
* **Multiplication:** Occasionally multiplies by '0' instead of the intended number.
* **Division:** Might round the result to the nearest whole number, or in rare cases, return a random number.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

    (If you are using a development environment like VS Code with Live Server, you can use that as well.)

## Contributing
